  # Project Readme
  
  ## Description
  I was quite excited to do this one since it us a sueful project for every project. It's a bit odd typing here because the termnial is kinda of acting up.  I did lelearn to use  inquierer. This terminal is just to weird. Bash does a better job.
  
  ## Installation
  you need ot run this in visual studio code -- install npm and  inquierer 8.2.4 and obviously node.js primalarly.
  
  ## Usage
  You use it for automatically formatting you readme.md file and as well as automaticcaly setting upo the structure.
  
  ## Contributing

  ## Tests
  This requires no testing it's just so perfect the way it is hahaha
