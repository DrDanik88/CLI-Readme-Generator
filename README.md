  ## Description
  I wanted to create a way that would be easy for me to create a high quality README.md file with all the required information. This code runs in a terminal and has all the questions needed.
  
  ## Installation
  Make sure you have VSCode installed <br>Node.js installed <br> then clone the repo and run index.js
  <br>**It is better to run it in an outside terminal instead of the integrated terminal of VSCode.
